# Multidimensional_Wellbeing_Peru
This repository provides the codes I created for my bachelor thesis called Assessing multidimensional well-being in Peru: an empirical operationalization of the capabilities approach through the estimation of Multiple Indicator and Multiple Cause Models . I used Survey on Multidimensional Wellbeing. This dataset was provided by Instituto de Desarrollo Humano de Am√©rica Latina (IDHAL-PUCP).
